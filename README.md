# Minecraft Computer

This is the world file for a hackathon project where we made an 8-bit minecraft computer and wrote a program to calculate the fibonacci sequence on it.

I made a youtube video showing a little bit about how it works and walking through the program. [You can watch it here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0tN85VsuDM&feature=youtu.be)

Also [this is the link](https://devpost.com/software/computer-crafting) to the devpost for the hackathon submission. You can view the other people who I worked with there.
